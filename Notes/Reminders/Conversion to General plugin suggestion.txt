On another note, something to think about: MediaFairy can update all libraries
 when the plugin is only installed in one library. 
If a user wants to update a library from within Meedios (meepopupprovider/meepopupimporter),
 the updater will run all the importers for the current library.
  So are currently two ways to update a library if MF is my importer
   (1) browse to the library were MF is configured and update ALL libraries 
   (2) install mediafairy in each library and configure them all individually. 

Let me know if that is incorrect (I haven't actually played with it). 
If I am right, I was thinking that one possible solution might be to turn MF
 into a general plugin. Then flclsd could add MF support
  to mepoppupimporter (This would be ideal) OR you could create a second plugin 
  that the user would have to install in each library
   that basically ties it to the general plugin. 

Not a high priority...I'm just throwing stuff out there...
